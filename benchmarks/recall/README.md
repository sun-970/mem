# Multilingual recall benchmark

This directory provides a small, repeatable retrieval benchmark. It is a
decision aid for comparing lexical, vector and hybrid configurations; it is
not evidence of production recall.

The default run is deliberately model-free and offline:

```bash
python3 -m benchmarks.recall run --output /tmp/mem-recall.json
```

It prints a concise summary and writes canonical, sorted JSON. The artifact is
always labeled:

```text
engine=lexical-reference
not production recall
```

The lexical adapter reports `0 ms` latency as a deterministic sentinel. It
measures ranking behavior only and must not be used as a performance result.

## Dataset and privacy

[`data/v1/dataset.json`](data/v1/dataset.json) declares the dataset version,
coverage, provenance and license. The JSONL corpus and queries plus
`qrels.json` cover:

- structured memories, text files and image captions;
- Chinese and English;
- exact terms, paraphrases, metadata/path/workspace filters and hard
  negatives.

Every record is hand-authored synthetic data. Names, projects, paths,
preferences and captions are fictional; nothing was copied from a user,
private repository or internal dataset. The fixtures are released as
CC0-1.0.

## Metrics and deterministic rules

The runner reports overall metrics and groups them by scenario slice,
language and expected source kind:

- macro Recall@1, Recall@5 and Recall@10;
- macro reciprocal rank (MRR) and graded nDCG@10;
- citation and source-kind correctness;
- error and partial-result rates;
- nearest-rank p50/p95 latency;
- forbidden-source count and rate.

Rules are embedded in every artifact:

1. A result list is deduplicated by `doc_id`; the first occurrence and its
   citation win.
2. External order is authoritative. The lexical adapter sorts descending by
   score, then ascending by document ID for a stable tie.
3. Qrel grades use the bounded `0..3` scale. Recall divides by every qrel with
   relevance greater than zero; nDCG uses the numeric grades.
4. Every query is equally weighted in macro metrics. `partial` and `error`
   queries stay in the denominator; an error has an empty result list and
   therefore zero retrieval metrics.
5. Citation accuracy divides by every deduplicated returned result through
   rank 10. Empty results score zero.
6. Source correctness is one value per query: the first relevant result must
   have the expected source kind; no relevant result scores zero.
7. Latency percentiles use nearest rank across every query status.
8. A result is leakage when its document is unknown or violates any query
   workspace, source-kind, metadata or path-prefix filter. Path prefixes match
   complete path segments: `/notes` matches `/notes/item`, never
   `/notes-secret` or `/notes2`.

Leakage is a hard safety invariant, not a quality threshold. A run writes its
artifact for diagnosis and exits `2` when leakage is non-zero.

## Test and compare the checked baseline

Run the complete hermetic gate:

```bash
make test-recall
```

This executes unit tests, runs the lexical adapter twice to prove semantic
determinism apart from `generated_at`, compares it with
[`baselines/lexical-reference.v1.json`](baselines/lexical-reference.v1.json),
and proves the malicious cross-workspace fixture is detected with a non-zero
exit.

To produce explicit absolute values and deltas:

```bash
python3 -m benchmarks.recall run \
  --output /tmp/candidate.json \
  --compare benchmarks/recall/baselines/lexical-reference.v1.json \
  --comparison-output /tmp/comparison.json
```

Comparison JSON includes absolute values and deltas overall and for every
scenario, language and source-kind group. It is informational only. There is
intentionally no guessed quality threshold; a future gating policy requires
separate review and evidence from enough representative runs.

Maintainers can intentionally re-record the reference after reviewing corpus,
metric or lexical changes:

```bash
make recall-baseline
git diff -- benchmarks/recall/baselines/lexical-reference.v1.json
```

## Opt-in vector or hybrid rankings

The harness never calls a provider. Run the candidate system separately,
without putting text, credentials or vectors in the artifact, and export one
ranked row for every dataset query. Start from
[`fixtures/external-rankings.example.v1.json`](fixtures/external-rankings.example.v1.json):

```bash
python3 -m benchmarks.recall run \
  --rankings /path/to/rankings.json \
  --output /tmp/vector-candidate.json \
  --compare benchmarks/recall/baselines/lexical-reference.v1.json
```

The external document is provider-agnostic but strict:

```json
{
  "schema_version": "mem.recall-rankings.v1",
  "engine": "my-vector-run",
  "configuration": {
    "mode": "vector",
    "provider": "explicit-provider",
    "model": "explicit-model",
    "dimension": 768,
    "index": {"kind": "hnsw", "distance": "cosine"},
    "search": {"top_k": 10}
  },
  "hardware": {"host": "coarse non-identifying class"},
  "queries": [{
    "query_id": "q-...",
    "status": "ok",
    "latency_ms": 12.5,
    "results": [{
      "doc_id": "file-...",
      "citation": "mem://files/file-...",
      "score": 0.8
    }]
  }]
}
```

`mode` is explicitly `lexical`, `vector` or `hybrid`. Vector and hybrid runs
require provider, model and a positive vector dimension. A lexical run must
explicitly set those three fields to `null`. Every mode requires non-empty
index/search configuration and a coarse hardware summary; nothing is silently
inferred. Each dataset query must appear exactly once. If a provider produces
no ranking because it failed, include that query with `status: "error"`, a
finite non-negative `latency_ms`, an empty `results` array and an optional
bounded `error_code`. `partial` keeps its returned results. Omitting a query is
invalid because absence must not be mistaken for a successful empty result.

The artifact records repository commit/dirty state, dataset checksum,
configuration, Python/platform summary, coarse candidate hardware, generation
time and sanitized query failures. It does not copy query text, corpus text,
vectors or free-form provider errors. Credential-shaped configuration keys
such as `api_key`, `password`, `secret`, `token` and `authorization` are
rejected instead of being copied into an artifact.

## Live memd producer

**NOT VERIFIED against a live memd instance.** The producer code and tests are
checked in, but no end-to-end run against a running `memd` has been recorded.
Issue #184's HOLD — "run the recall benchmark against a live deployment and
attach the ranking artifact" — still requires a real production-class run; the
fixture-level tests in this PR are **not** a substitute for that live
acceptance. Do not close #184 on the basis of this PR alone.

The `produce` subcommand queries a running `memd` over every dataset query and
emits a `mem.recall-rankings.v1` file that the existing `run --rankings` path
consumes. Latency is measured client-side per request; the `0 ms` sentinel
warning above applies only to the offline lexical lane.

```bash
python3 -m benchmarks.recall produce \
  --memd-url http://localhost:8080 \
  --token "$MEM_TOKEN" \
  --output /tmp/live-rankings.json \
  --dimension 1536 \
  --mode hybrid
```

Then score it against the lexical baseline:

```bash
python3 -m benchmarks.recall run \
  --rankings /tmp/live-rankings.json \
  --output /tmp/live-artifact.json \
  --compare benchmarks/recall/baselines/lexical-reference.v1.json
```

The producer maps each API result back to a dataset `doc_id` by matching the
`path` field returned by `/v1/search` against the corpus. When multiple
documents share a path, the snippet text is used to pick the best overlap.
Query filters are translated where the API supports them: `path_prefix` becomes
`scope`, and `source_kind` becomes `type` (`image_caption` → `image`,
`text` → `text`). The `workspace` filter is not sent to the API because the
auth token determines workspace scope.

Adjust `--dimension`, `--mode`, `--provider` and `--model` to match the
embedding configuration of the live system. The emitted `configuration` block
is populated from these flags, not hand-written, so the artifact cannot be
mistaken for the lexical reference.
